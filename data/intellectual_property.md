# Intellectual Property Law

Intellectual property (IP) law protects creations of the mind. IP rights encourage innovation and provide legal protection for businesses and individuals.

## Types of IP

- **Trademarks:** Protect brand names, logos, slogans, and other identifiers.
- **Copyrights:** Protect original literary, artistic, and software works.
- **Trade Secrets:** Protect confidential business information that provides a competitive edge.

## Importance
IP law prevents unauthorized use of intellectual property, supports business growth, and enables creators to monetize their inventions or works.
