# Corporate Law Overview

Corporate law is the body of law that governs the formation, operation, and dissolution of corporations. 
It covers a wide range of areas including incorporation, corporate governance, mergers and acquisitions, compliance, and shareholder rights.

## Incorporation
To form a corporation, founders must file articles of incorporation with the state government, adopt corporate bylaws, and issue stock to initial shareholders. Incorporation provides limited liability protection to owners.

## Corporate Governance
Corporate governance involves the system of rules, practices, and processes by which a company is directed and controlled. 
The Board of Directors oversees major corporate decisions, ensures compliance with laws, and protects shareholder interests.

## Mergers and Acquisitions
M&A deals involve complex legal processes including due diligence, drafting agreements, and regulatory approvals. Proper legal counsel is critical to protect corporate and shareholder interests.
