The bread is usually slathered with pâté or mayonnaise, then filled with a mix of proteins (such as Vietnamese pork sausage “chả lụa,” grilled pork, or tofu), pickled vegetables, fresh herbs, sliced cucumber, and a splash of chili or hot sauce. The dish originated during the French colonial period when the French introduced the baguette to Vietnam; Vietnamese cooks adapted it with their own flavors, creating the iconic fusion we know today.\n\n**Current weather in Vietnam**  \nAs of 3 Oct 2025, Hanoi is experiencing a **partly cloudy** sky with a temperature of **33 °C (91.8 °F)**. The wind is coming from the southeast at about **10 km/h (6.7 mph)**, humidity is **59 %**, and the “feels‑like” temperature is around **38 °C (100.9 °F)**. Conditions are mild with no precipitation expected."
