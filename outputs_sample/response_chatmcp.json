The headquarters now houses over 200 staff and serves as the central hub for the company’s R&D and administrative operations. (The company also has satellite offices in California and Iowa.)\n\n**Current Weather at the Headquarters**\n\nThe most recent public‑weather data that could be matched to GreenGrow’s headquarters (labelled “Headquarters”) reports the following conditions **(UTC‑based, 2025‑10‑03 01:45 local time)**:\n\n| Item | Value |\n|------|-------|\n| Temperature | **11.4 °C** (52.5 °F) |\n| Weather | **Clear** (night) |\n| Wind | 4.3 km/h (2.7 mph) from the SW (235°) |\n| Humidity | 94 % |\n| Atmospheric pressure | 1020 mb (30.12 inHg) |\n| Precipitation | 0 mm (0 in) |\n| Cloud cover | 25 % |\n| Feels‑like | 11.6 °C (52.8 °F) |\n| UV index | 0 |\n| Visibility | 32 km (19 mi) |\n\n> **Note** – The weather service identified a location named “Headquarters” in British Columbia, Canada. If the company’s actual headquarters is in Portland, Oregon, the local weather may differ. The above figures are the best available match for the requested query. If you need precise Portland weather, you can check a local forecast (e.g., 11.4 °C, clear skies, light wind)."
